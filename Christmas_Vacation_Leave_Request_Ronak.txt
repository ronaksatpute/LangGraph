Subject: Request for Christmas Vacation Leave

Dear Michael Fuchs,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally request vacation leave for the upcoming Christmas holiday season. I would like to take leave from 15th December to 28th December, returning to work on [return date]. The reason for my request is that I will be traveling to Mumbai, India during the Christmas break to spend time with my family.

I have ensured that all my current projects and responsibilities will be managed smoothly in my absence. Kim has kindly agreed to cover any urgent matters during this period.

Please let me know if you need any further information or if there are forms or procedures I should complete.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your approval.

Warm regards,

Ronak
